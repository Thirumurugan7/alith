That\u2019s what we\u2019ve done with the prototype so far.\nWe\u2019re still a small team and looking for more developers to help bring the combat experience to life, especially engine-side. If you or anyone you know is excited by that vision, we\u2019d love to collaborate even sharing our project with friends helps a lot. Your support, both in words and connections, means everything at this stage."

More and more companies are turning to AI tools to automate these jobs and free up precious time to some guy in the company.\nI\u2019m talking about you, the operators. You\u2019re the people who keep projects on track, make sure everyone knows what they\u2019re doing, and help teams actually get things done.

You\u2019re juggling timelines, coordinating devs and designers, checking community sentiment, keeping stakeholders updated, chasing people for approvals, monitoring governance proposals, handling compliance checks, and making sure a dozen moving parts don\u2019t crash into each other.\nIt\u2019s a LOT. And let\u2019s be realistic, some of it\u2019s very annoying, and you might be thinking why me ???\nLike manually updating dashboards with the latest on-chain data, tracking smart contract deployments across multiple chains, prepping endless reports, or combing through Discord for community feedback.\nHere\u2019s where AI comes in to make life easier:\nImagine AI tools that auto-summarize long governance threads so you\u2019re not reading walls of text.

                "comment": "Awesome summary of how AI is transforming operations, and a great question.\nI believe nothing will ever replace genuine, authentic human judgment when it comes to organizing a project\u2019s work. But AI is an incredibly powerful tool that makes our work more efficient, faster, and easier. For me, it\u2019s a huge time-saver and an always-available assistant, even when a crazy idea pops into my head in the middle of the night, I can instantly ask AI whether it\u2019s feasible.\nNothing can replace human-to-human interaction, with all the empathy and nuance it brings. But embracing AI as a tool to support your work can make your job smoother and a lot more enjoyable.\nAs I mentioned, one of the ways I use AI in my workflow is by sharing all possible information about the project and regularly discussing new features, updates, and any issues that arise. Over time, as it learns this context, AI becomes an even better and more effective assistant. In a way, we learn from each other."

                "comment": "This resonates deeply with me, especially around non-violent communication. AI has become my go-to tool for reframing thoughts that might come across as judgmental or confrontational. We\u2019re all raised with \u201cviolent communication\u201d patterns - the constant framing of right vs wrong, good vs bad - and it\u2019s so deeply embedded that we don\u2019t even notice it.\nHaving AI help translate ideas into more collaborative language has been transformative. Instead of saying \u201cthis approach is wrong,\u201d I can explore \u201chere\u2019s another perspective to consider.\u201d It\u2019s like having a communication coach that helps you embody better principles in real-time.\nBeyond communication, AI has revolutionized my operational workflow. It parses meeting notes to extract actionable tasks, troubleshoots technical configurations that used to require specialists, and catches details I would have missed. What used to take hours of coordination now happens in minutes.\nBut here\u2019s what I find most valuable: AI as a source of inspiration and perspective. Because it has access to such diverse knowledge, it surfaces approaches and viewpoints that wouldn\u2019t naturally occur to me. It helps break me out of my usual thinking patterns and consider challenges from angles I might never have explored.\nThe philosophical implications are fascinating too. When we use AI to enhance our communication and thinking, we\u2019re essentially creating space for more thoughtful, less reactive responses. That\u2019s fundamentally about becoming better humans, not just more efficient operators.\nGreat article\n@CrisMetis\n!"

Launched my Twitter + started building in public\nShowed up every day. Shared progress.\nThis is my first step into real startup marketing.\n3.

First screen = first step to real product.\n5. Understood the tech architecture\nHow everything connects: smart contracts, data flows, frontend logic.\n6. Learned by walking in the user\u2019s shoes\nI tried trading perps.\nI tried providing liquidity.\nNow I feel what my user needs. That\u2019s gold.\n7. Made big tech decisions\nAfter deep research, I chose GMX V1 as the base. It\u2019s stable, simple, well-documented. Perfect for MVP.\n8. Realized the scale of the journey\nIt\u2019s long.\nIt\u2019s exciting.\nAnd I\u2019m all in.\nWhat went well:\nI made decisions with clarity\nI worked on my mindset\nI found a vision that gives me fire in the eyes\nMistakes I made:\nDived too deep into tech too early\nShould\u2019ve explored UX flows & user journey before obsessing over smart contracts.\nPlan for next week (week 2):\nFocus hard on the technical build:\n\u2013 Build a simple frontend to open positions\n\u2013 Dive deep into smart contract structure\n\u2013 Connect frontend + contracts on Arbitrum testnet\nIdeal outcome = MVP skeleton working.\nThanks to everyone who\u2019s followed this journey so far.\nNow it\u2019s time to breathe, reset, and get ready for WEEK 2.\nLet\u2019s keep building"

Give them a GitHub repo, API key, and a 5-minute tutorial.\nBe where they are. Hang out in dev chats. Answer questions. Be human.\nSkip the pitch. Talk about use cases, integrations, and real issues you solve.\nCo-create with them. Open-source your SDKs, run hackathons, or feature dev-built tools.\nLet the product speak. Your best marketing is a tool that just\u2026 works.\nFinal Thought\nDevelopers don\u2019t want fluff , they want tools, truth, and trust.

So instead of marketing at them, think about enabling them.\nHere\u2019s a quick breakdown of what works vs. what doesn\u2019t:\nWhat Works What to Avoid\nClear docs with real code examples Buzzwords without substance\nGitHub, Discord, and open communities Gated PDFs, email capture forms\nCLI tools, APIs, and fast onboarding Long signup flows\nTutorials, use cases, and hackathons Overly polished \u201cbrand videos\u201d\nContent written by developers Blog posts that sound like press releases\nDev-Friendly Marketing Channels (Visual Breakdown)\nHere\u2019s a simple chart of channels developers actually engage with vs. those they often ignore:\nHigh Trust & Engagement\n\u2502\n\u251c\u2500\u2500 GitHub Readmes & Wikis\n\u251c\u2500\u2500 Technical Docs\n\u251c\u2500\u2500 Open Source Demos\n\u251c\u2500\u2500 Stack Overflow / Dev Forums\n\u251c\u2500\u2500 Twitter (dev-side of Crypto Twitter)\n\u251c\u2500\u2500 Discord/Slack for support\n\u251c\u2500\u2500 Blog posts with tutorials\n\u2502\n\u2514\u2500\u2500 YouTube (ONLY for walkthroughs, not ads)\n\u2193\n\u2193\u2193\u2193\nLow Trust & Engagement\n\u251c\u2500\u2500 Paid banner ads\n\u251c\u2500\u2500 Corporate LinkedIn posts\n\u2514\u2500\u2500 Buzzword-heavy homepage sliders\nPractical Tips to Win Developer Hearts (and Adoption)\nShow, don\u2019t tell. Give them a GitHub repo, API key, and a 5-minute tutorial.\nBe where they are. Hang out in dev chats. Answer questions. Be human.\nSkip the pitch. Talk about use cases, integrations, and real issues you solve.\nCo-create with them. Open-source your SDKs, run hackathons, or feature dev-built tools.\nLet the product speak. Your best marketing is a tool that just\u2026 works.\nFinal Thought\nDevelopers don\u2019t want fluff , they want tools, truth, and trust. If you\u2019re helpful, authentic, and transparent, they\u2019ll not only use your product, they\u2019ll advocate for it. And there\u2019s no better growth engine than that."

                "comment": "This sounds like a really interesting project, Tony! The concept of turning crypto trading into a fighting game with real-time simulation and on-chain verification is quite innovative.\nHere are a few thoughts and potential discussion points for you, based on your post:\nMetis Hyperion Integration: You mentioned deploying your first on-chain logic using Metis\u2019s Hyperion. This is a great way to leverage the speed and security of the Metis L2 network. I\u2019m curious about what specific gameplay elements you plan to make cryptographically verifiable. Are you thinking about verifiable randomness for match outcomes, or perhaps on-chain escrow for in-game assets?\nCommunity Engagement: The leaderboards, referral system, and missions are excellent for driving user engagement. Have you considered any tokenomics or NFT integration strategies to further incentivize participation and long-term retention?\nTechnical Challenges: Transitioning from a Telegram Mini App to a full web app while maintaining real-time gameplay and integrating on-chain mechanics sounds technically challenging. What are some of the biggest hurdles you\u2019re anticipating, and how are you planning to address them?\nI\u2019d also recommend sharing this project in the #ideation channel on the LazAI Discord. There are a lot of knowledgeable people there who could provide valuable feedback and suggestions.\nTo find the discord, you can use this search query: LazAI Discord"

All core actions such as betting, creating and joining games, opening/closing positions, and finalizing are performed on-chain. The backend plays a supporting role: validating on-chain activity, relaying messages between players, and tracking game states.\nBackend Responsibilities\nEvent Listener\nListens to smart contract events\nTracks and syncs game states (pending, active, completed) with a centralized DB\nKeeps game data fresh for frontend UX (matchmaking, game history, rewards)\nRemoves games if the creator goes offline\nGame Status and Matchmaking API\n/api/game/create validates initGame transactions\n/games/waiting-for-opponent returns available games to join\n/api/game/start validates joinGame transactions\nSignature Relay\n/api/position/signature provides backend EIP-712 signature for opening positions\nWebSocket or long polling is used to relay signature requests:\nPlayer 2 \u2192 Backend \u2192 Player 1 \u2192 (Signs) \u2192 Backend \u2192 Player 2\nGame Watchdog\nTracks whether the game creator (Player 1) is online\nHides the game from the list if the creator is offline\nDuring joinGame, the contract validates Player 1\u2019s short-TTL signature, proving they were online and approved the join\nFrontend Responsibilities\nGame Start\nUser clicks \u201cStart Fight\u201d and selects a fighter\nFrontend queries /games/waiting-for-opponent\nIf a game is found, it requests a join signature from Player 1 via backend\nIf no game is found, frontend calls initGame(poolAddress, betAmount)\nAfter the transaction is confirmed, backend validates it via /api/game/create\nMatchmaking UI\nDisplays a waiting screen with a countdown\nOptionally subscribes to real-time updates via WebSocket\nIn-Game Trading\nopenHashedPosition(gameId, directionHash, backendSignature) is used to open a position (direction is hidden initially)\nSignature is retrieved from /api/position/signature\nclosePosition(gameId, direction, nonce) is used to reveal and close the position\nFinalization\nOnce both players have closed their positions, the creator finalizes the game via finalizeGame(gameId)\nIf someone is unresponsive, backend triggers forced finalization after timeout\nSmart Contract Core Functions\ninitGame(poolAddress, betAmount) locks the bet and creates a game\njoinGame(gameId, poolAddress, betAmount, joinSignature) lets the second player join\nopenHashedPosition(gameId, directionHash, backendSignature) opens a hashed position\nclosePosition(gameId, direction, nonce) reveals and settles the position\nfinalizeGame(gameId) settles rewards and closes the game\nGame Pool Whitelist\nThe contract stores a whitelist of allowed DEX pools for each network\nOnly the owner can modify the list to prevent use of fake or manipulatable pools\nThe contract uses these whitelisted pools to fetch real-time prices for PnL and trade validation\nOpen Questions\nHow to efficiently track intermediate game state (e.g., opponent\u2019s position, PnL) \u2014 will likely be handled off-chain via event polling\nFail-safes and abuse prevention:\nJoin TTL signatures required from Player 1\nFirst-come, first-serve enforcement on backend and contract\nPool whitelist enforced in contract\nSecurity Measures\nOnly whitelisted pools are used\nAll actions require confirmed on-chain transactions\nTTL-based join signatures ensure liveness and prevent stolen entries\nBackend signs position hashes to enable forced closure if needed"

Decentralized doesn\u2019t mean unfiltered.\nAttribution is a Nightmare\nHow do we accurately track which datasets directly influenced a model\u2019s output especially in multi-source training scenarios? Without granular attribution, revenue-sharing quickly becomes speculative or unfair.\nGaming the System\nTokenized rewards always open the door to manipulation. Think botnets uploading synthetic data or feedback loops designed solely to trigger payout thresholds. This needs aggressive prevention design.\nLegal & Ethical Landmines\nIf a user uploads copyrighted or sensitive data, who\u2019s liable? The protocol? The contributors? The downstream AI project? Decentralization doesn\u2019t erase legal responsibility.\nRevenue Distribution Models Are Still Vague\nHow exactly will revenue be split between thousands of contributors? Based on access? Utility? Frequency of use? These formulas will need to be not only transparent but also defensible under scrutiny.h\nSo yes DATs might offer a new design space, but turning them into a reliable, abuse-resistant, and value-aligned mechanism for AI is far from solved.\nBuilders should proceed but with eyes wide open."

Sports betting AI would definitely benefit from DATs, you could access real-time injury reports, fan insights, weather data, social sentiment, and local news that traditional expensive data feeds miss. The tricky part is ensuring data quality since bad info costs real money in betting, plus you\u2019d need lightning-fast verification for time-sensitive updates like last-minute player changes. The financial incentives could also create serious gaming risks with fake reports or manipulated sentiment. But if you can solve the quality control and real-time verification challenges, you\u2019d have access to way more comprehensive data than what\u2019s currently available. What specific data gaps are you seeing that existing sources don\u2019t cover well?"

The integration with Alith for conversational discovery and usage is a great feature. The gamified AI economy campaign is also a clever way to encourage adoption and experimentation.\nA few questions/thoughts:\nSmart Contract Details: What blockchain(s) are the smart contracts deployed on? Are there any specific gas optimization techniques being used, considering the per-request payment model?\nPricing Flexibility: The description mentions \u201cper-call, per-token, tiered billing.\u201d Can you elaborate on the types of tiered billing supported?\nSecurity Considerations: What security measures are in place to prevent abuse or malicious usage of the monetized endpoints?\nOpen Source: When will the GitHub repository be available?\nI think this project has the potential to significantly contribute to the Hyperion ecosystem by enabling a more sustainable and scalable model for decentralized AI development."

To keep gas costs low, we use the minimal-proxy pattern (EIP-1167) to spin up new wrappers in a few hundred bytes, and we batch-update usage counters instead of writing to storage on every single call.\n2. Pricing Flexibility\nYou can choose any mix of:\nFlat per-call fees (e.g. 0.01 METIS each)\nCredit-based billing, where you buy tokens or credits that get burned as you consume resources\nTiered or subscription plans, like volume discounts (first 10 calls at 0.01 METIS, next 90 at 0.008) or prepaid blocks of calls at a reduced rate.\n3. Security Considerations\nWe\u2019ve built in several safeguards:\nPrepaid deposits so you can\u2019t run up an unexpected bill\nChecks-effects-interactions and OpenZeppelin libraries to avoid reentrancy and other pitfalls\nOn-chain rate limits or quotas per user or API key\nAn emergency \u201ccircuit breaker\u201d to pause a service if something looks fishy.\n4. Open Source\nThe GitHub repo goes live in about two weeks. We\u2019ll open the contracts, playground UI, and Alith integration code \u2014and welcome your PRs, issues, and \u201cFounding Contributor\u201d badges from release Day."

Retail investors struggle to keep up with rapidly changing market conditions and protocols, leading to suboptimal yield and high risks. There\u2019s a need for a system that automates intelligent yield allocation while remaining transparent, secure, and accessible.\nSolution Overview\niYield is an on-chain AI-powered vault protocol that automates capital allocation across yield strategies. Leveraging Hyperion\u2019s parallel execution and on-chain AI capabilities, iYield dynamically rebalances funds across multiple DeFi protocols to optimize returns. Our system democratizes advanced yield optimization, removing the barrier of technical know-how while ensuring transparency and performance. By bringing AI workflows directly on-chain, iYield introduces fully verifiable, trustless DeFi asset management for everyone.\nProject Description\niYield is a modular DeFAI protocol offering Smart Vaults, AI-driven investment vaults that manage yield strategies in real-time. It uses a rebalancing engine built on on-chain AI models to evaluate yield rates, risk metrics, gas costs, and liquidity across various DeFi protocols. Users deposit into Smart Vaults, which then allocate funds automatically based on performance and risk profiles determined by the AI.\nWe plan to leverage Hyperion\u2019s high-throughput parallel execution, real-time inference for LLMs, and Optimistic Rollup support to enable seamless AI decision-making directly on-chain. Core features will include vault creation, AI strategy selection, real-time performance analytics, and dynamic allocation. What excites us is the possibility of making DeFi investment smarter, faster, and fairer thus empowering users with minimal effort and maximum transparency.\nCommunity Engagement Features\nTo incentivize engagement, iYield will integrate a gamified testnet experience:\nTestable Tasks: Deposit into a Super Vault, simulate a rebalancing operation, vote on a community strategy proposal, and complete an educational quiz.\nPoints System: Each task earns users points (e.g., Deposit = 20 pts, Rebalance Sim = 30 pts, Vote = 15 pts, Quiz = 10 pts).\nGamification Mechanics: Leaderboards, NFT badges for milestones, and early-user rewards tied to accumulated points.\nGetting Involved\nCommunity members can join via:\nDiscord/Telegram: Contribute feedback, ideas, and test features.\nGitHub: Collaborate on smart contract development or audit code.\nContent Creation: Help with educational materials, documentation, or translations.\nEarly Access: Sign up as a beta tester to help shape iYield and earn rewards.\nMORE INFO SOON",

However, what sets iYield apart is our Autopilot feature, a layer powered by AI agents with distinct behavioral traits like Predictive Learner, Short-Term Flipper, Long-Term Holder, Yield DCA Agent, Stablecoin Maximalist.\nThese AI agents analyze user manual/on-chain activity patterns and leverage trained data models to:\nAutomatically allocate user capital to the most optimal Vaults/Pools (if Autopilot is fully enabled).\nSuggest the best strategies for manual selection (if Autopilot is partially enabled).\nThis allows users to benefit from personalized, data-driven yield optimization without needing deep DeFi expertise.\nNon-Custodial by Design\nYes, the iYield protocol is fully non-custodial. Users retain control over their funds at all times. Deposits and withdrawals can be made directly from Vaults/Pools at any time \u2014 we never take ownership or custody of user assets."

While our AI agents assist with portfolio decisions, users can set explicit preferences to control what the Smart Vault is allowed to do.\nFor example, a user might permit their Smart Vault to automatically exit positions when risk thresholds are breached, but require manual approval for new deposits.\nThis hybrid model ensures that users remain in control while still benefiting from intelligent automation.\nWe\u2019re also exploring additional risk management features, such as customizable risk-reward ratios. While risk can\u2019t be completely eliminated, we aim to minimize it as much as possible.\nEach AI agent is defined by a set of traits, and each trait carries a specific risk factor. Based on this, users can assess the cumulative risk of their Smart Vaults and make informed decisions."

        "content": "Haithe\nA Decentralized Protocol for Verifiable AI.\nThe Problem\nThe core challenge for AI in Web3 isn\u2019t just proving that data hasn\u2019t been tampered with; it\u2019s proving the data\u2019s substance. A cryptographic hash can guarantee a dataset\u2019s integrity, but it cannot verify its origin, quality, or content. A creator could claim their AI is trained on financial data when it was actually trained on irrelevant information, and the hash would still be valid.\nThis \u201csemantic gap\u201d creates a trust vacuum, preventing developers from confidently building high-stakes applications that rely on third-party AI agents.\nThe Solution\nHaithe is a trust protocol that solves this problem by creating a transparent, verifiable ecosystem for AI. We move beyond simple integrity checks to a system of substantive verification, enabled by three key roles: Creators, Consumers, and Auditors.\nInstead of just registering a data hash, creators submit a detailed Claim Manifest about their dataset. Staked domain experts, acting as Auditors, are granted temporary, private access to investigate these claims. Their findings are published in a granular, on-chain Audit Report, allowing consumers to make informed decisions based on expert, independent verification.\nHow It Works: A Three-Part Ecosystem\nHaithe\u2019s workflow ensures checks and balances between all participants, with smart contracts on Hyperion orchestrating the process.\n1. The Creator: Defining the Claims\nBuild & Register: Developers use the Alith framework to build high-performance AI agents and register them on the Haithe marketplace.\nSubmit the Claim Manifest: Alongside the agent, the Creator submits a structured manifest containing specific, falsifiable claims about the training data. For example:\nSource: \u201cAPI data from Uniswap v3 on Polygon.\u201d\nDate Range: \u201cAll swaps from June 1, 2023, to December 31, 2023.\u201d\nContent: \u201cDataset contains no personally identifiable information (PII).\u201d\nSchema: \u201cIncludes columns for token_pair, amount_in, amount_out, and gas_price.\u201d\n2. The Auditor: Investigating the Substance\nStake & Qualify: Domain experts (in finance, NLP, security, etc.) stake tokens to become eligible Auditors.\nAccept the Task: An Auditor accepts an audit request, which can be funded by the Creator or a Consumer.\nInvestigate Claims: The Auditor is granted secure, time-limited, off-chain access to the private dataset. Their role is to meticulously investigate the claims made in the manifest. This requires genuine domain expertise.\nPublish the Audit Report: The Auditor submits a detailed report to IPFS, with its hash recorded on-chain. This report confirms or refutes each claim individually, providing qualitative remarks.\n3. The Consumer: Making Informed Decisions\nDiscover & Filter: Developers browse the Haithe marketplace for AI agents. They can filter for agents based on their audit status.\nReview Reports: Before subscribing, a Consumer can review the detailed Audit Report for any agent.

Thanks again for your interest in our project and for the thoughtful questions. Let me address each of them below\n1) If the dataset is private, how do you ensure Auditors don\u2019t misuse or leak it?\nGreat question. In our current model, auditors must undergo two layers of validation before they\u2019re granted access:\nFirst, they are verified by us (the platform) based on identity and domain expertise.\nSecond, they are validated by the DAO, ensuring community-level accountability.\nWhile trust in auditors is still required to some extent, just like in real-world auditing , we are actively exploring ways to make this process more trustless.\n2) Are Creators allowed to challenge an audit report if they think it\u2019s unfair or inaccurate?\nYes, it\u2019s a crucial safeguard.\nWe agree that auditors shouldn\u2019t have unchecked authority. Creators will have the ability to challenge audit reports, either by:\nRequesting a re-audit (potentially by a different auditor or group of auditors), or\nSubmitting a formal rebuttal that gets appended to the audit report for transparency.\n3) What kinds of use cases are you targeting first \u2013 trading bots, oracles, LLMs?\nOur initial focus is on trading bots and LLMs. These use cases have both high impact and urgent need for trust and verifiability."

                "comment": "Helloo, Apologies for the delayed response, I really appreciate your thoughtful question!\nAs a consumer, audits are exactly what enable trust that an AI agent\u2019s data truly comes from the sources claimed. Each audit report goes into technical detail, verifying every claim made in the agent\u2019s Claim Manifest \u2014 like the data source, date range, schema, and more.\nAnd yes, confidence naturally increases when multiple auditors review the same dataset. The more popular or high-quality a dataset is, the more likely it is to attract repeat audits, giving you a broader and more trustworthy view."
